# 🚗 Smart Vehicle Communication System (SVCS)

A **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)** inspired project that simulates **real-time communication between vehicles, traffic signals, and emergency systems** to improve **road safety, traffic flow, and emergency response efficiency**.

This web-based system demonstrates **V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle)**, **V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure)**, and **Emergency Green Corridor routing** through an interactive real-time simulation.
